Implementation:
My framework is : 
1. check if it is batch mode 
2. take in the command line from file or from user (based on different modes) 
3. tokenize the command line and save it 
4. check if it is built-in function, and execute it
5. loop again until meet some required conditions
Any bugs:
idk..
How to run:
1. go to the current directory and use "make" to create mysh.o executable file
2. use "./mysh" or "./mysh examplebatch" to run the shell or read the commands in batch mode
3. you will see the output in the console
